# FOVE C++ Example

This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates how to use the FOVE SDK. It currently does the following:
- DirectX setup
- Orientation tracking
- Position tracking
- Stereo rendering
- Submitting frames to the FOVE Compositor

More features are planned in the future, including Eye Tracking.

## How to build

To build and run, follow these steps:

1. Ensure CMake (https://cmake.org/) and Visual Studio 2015 or later are installed.
2. Run CMake to generate a 64-bit Visual Studio project (make sure to select a 64 bit generator such as "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64")
3. Open the generated Visual Studio project, and build and run from there.
