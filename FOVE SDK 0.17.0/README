This FOVE SDK distribution allows application developers to create software that works with the Fove HMD.

It is a work in progress and while we will do our best to not introduce breaking changes, sometimes this is inevitable in the software lifetime development cycle.

Documentation is available on our developer site: https://www.getfove.com/developers/ and is also available in the SDK zip file.
A developer forum is available at: http://forum.getfove.com/
Unity & Unreal plugins are also available on our developer site.

If you've found this and don't know who we are or why we're here please check out http://www.getfove.com/

For beginners, we recommend using Unity, as it's the fastest and easiest way to quickly build content for FOVE.

== ChangeLog ==

v0.17.0
- Log statements the in FoveClient library no longer go to stdout by default (they still go to the fove log)
- Remove the pupilRadiusL/R fields of the Fove::ResearchGaze and replace them by eyeDataL/R structures containing both eyeball, iris and pupil radius size information. Reflect the changes on the different bindings (Python/C#).
- C#: Rename Fove::Ray to Fove::EyeRay and Fove::Quaternion into Fove:Quat to avoid name conflicts when used with Unity
- Linux/Mac: Add *alpha* versions of Linux/Mac client binaries. These are alpha and not fully functional yet, and no backwards compatibility is yet supported for non-windows clients.
- C++: Add noexcept specifiers to the C API when compiled in C++ mode. C API never throws.
- C++: Quaternion struct defaults to identity (0, 0, 0, 1) instead of all zeros, as originally intended.
- C/C++/C#: Add APIs to register/unregister a new capability after creation of the headset.

v0.16.1
- NEW: Python API (Beta) added
- Added Result::valueOr(default) convenience helper to C++ API
- Added Result:isValid() convenience helper to the C++ API
